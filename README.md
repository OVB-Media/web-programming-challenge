# Web Programming Challenge

Thank you for participating in the web programming challenge!

To fulfill this challenge, you can use any technology you feel comfortable with, or maybe you even use this project to check out something new to you.

## Objective

Create the UI for asking a LLM a question and displaying the answer.

**Features**:

- Input field for asking question
- Limit the question field to 200 characters
- Show the remaining characters as the user types
- Submit button to send question
- Display of the answer
- Possibility to ask another question (no chat history necessary)

**Nice to have**:

- +1 for code quality checks (e.g. linting)
- +1 for implementing tests
- +1 for a nice looking UI

## Resources

Use something like [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) to serve a LLM locally.
